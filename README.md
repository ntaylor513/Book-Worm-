 Readerswin- Who We Are?
"I read and I know things". This is one of the most popular quotes that describe the character, Tyrion Lannister in ‘Game of Thrones’- one of the most popular TV shows in the world. According to the story, he was just an imp who had nothing but his knowledge that kept him surviving and ultimately helped him to position him as the hand of the king. This is a perfect example of what can be achieved through the habit of reading and learning daily.
Intending to promote the value of reading, Readerswin started its operation as a digital platform providing huge knowledge and giving rewards for the readers. We are inspired to make the world a better place by providing opportunities to learn via our website. The initiative of helping the readers specially tailored for middle school children was back with the idea of giving those rewards through the development of Bookworm token. The token is an accepted payment pathway to our products in our store. Therefore they can use it to buy any product that is listed on our website. It gives the motivation to the readers to engage in reading as they get two birds at one time. This is the origin of the Bookworm Crypto token. 
A Future with Exceptional Rewards 
As a non-profit organization, Readerswin is expecting to expand its rewards by providing scholarship programs for the students who need them. Through the success of our Bookworm Crypto token, we are planning to make significant changes in the educational sector all around the world.
Learn while Earning
Learning while earning is the key concept behind formulating Readerswin. In addition to providing the valuable Bookworm Crypto token rewards, children also can play this as a game. Therefore, our platform users always enjoy their time while gaining the best value of their time.
